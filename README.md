# Eth2 Deposit Watch

Some python tooling to pull deposit data information from Goerli, and construct a list of validators.

Use at your own risk.

## Usage

1. Create and open a venv
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `python construct_validators.py`

## Plans

Currently it only pulls the information once. Maybe start a website, and show this information live for testnets?
